## 1. Introduction to Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a statistical method used to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a likelihood function. The likelihood function measures how likely it is to observe the given data under different parameter values. By finding the parameter values that make the observed data most probable, MLE provides efficient and unbiased estimates, especially with large datasets.

In NLP, MLE is pivotal for tasks that involve probabilistic models, such as estimating the probability of words in a language model, determining the most probable part-of-speech tags, and aligning words in machine translation systems.

## 2. Definition of MLE

### 2.1. Likelihood Function

Given a set of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data points $D = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ and a statistical model parameterized by $\theta$, the **likelihood function** $\mathcal{L}(\theta | D)$ is defined as the probability of observing the data given the parameters:


$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta | D) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{P}(x_i | \theta)
$$

### 2.2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** seeks the parameter $\theta$ that maximizes the likelihood function:

<p>
$$
\hat{\theta}_{MLE} = \arg\max_{\theta} \mathcal{L}(\theta | D)
$$
</p>


Alternatively, since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, MLE can be performed by maximizing the **log-likelihood**:

$$
\log \mathcal{L}(\theta | D) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log \mathbb{P}(x_i | \theta)
$$

Maximizing the log-likelihood often simplifies the computation, especially when dealing with products of probabilities.

## 3. Properties of MLE

1. **Consistency:**
   As the sample size $n$ increases, the MLE $\hat{\theta}_{MLE}$ converges in probability to the true parameter value $\theta_0$.

2. **Asymptotic Normality:**
   For large $n$, the distribution of $\hat{\theta}_{MLE}$ approaches a normal distribution centered at $\theta_0$ with variance $\frac{1}{nI(\theta_0)}$, where $I(\theta_0)$ is the Fisher Information.

3. **Efficiency:**
   Among all consistent estimators, MLE achieves the lowest possible variance in the limit of large samples.

4. **Invariance:**
   If $g(\theta)$ is a transformation of $\theta$, then:
   
<p>
$$
\hat{g(\theta)}_{MLE} = g(\hat{\theta}_{MLE})
$$
</p>

## 4. MLE in NLP

Maximum Likelihood Estimation is extensively utilized in various NLP tasks to estimate model parameters based on observed data. Below are some prominent applications:

### Language Modeling

**Objective:** Estimate the probability of a sequence of words in a language.

**Example:**

Given a corpus of text, estimate the probability of each word $w$ in the vocabulary $V$:


$$
\mathbb{P}(w) = \frac{\text{Count}(w)}{\sum_{w' \in V} \text{Count}(w')}
$$

**MLE Approach:**

- **Data (D):** All words in the corpus.
- **Parameter ($\theta$):** $\mathbb{P}(w)$ for each $w \in V$.
- **Likelihood Function:**


$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta | D) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{P}(w_i | \theta)
$$

- **MLE Estimate:**


$$
\hat{\mathbb{P}}(w) = \frac{\text{Count}(w)}{n}
$$

### Part-of-Speech Tagging

**Objective:** Assign the most probable part-of-speech tag to each word in a sentence.

**Example:**

Using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for POS tagging, estimate transition probabilities $\mathbb{P}(t_j | t_i)$ and emission probabilities $\mathbb{P}(w | t)$ using MLE.

**MLE Approach:**

- **Data (D):** Annotated corpus with word-tag pairs.
- **Parameters:**
  - Transition probabilities between tags.
  - Emission probabilities of words given tags.
- **Likelihood Function:**


$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta | D) = \prod_{s=1}^{n} \mathbb{P}(t_s | t_{s-1}) \cdot \mathbb{P}(w_s | t_s)
$$

- **MLE Estimates:**
  - $\hat{\mathbb{P}}(t_j | t_i) = \frac{\text{Count}(t_i \rightarrow t_j)}{\text{Count}(t_i)}$
  - $\hat{\mathbb{P}}(w | t) = \frac{\text{Count}(w, t)}{\text{Count}(t)}$

### Machine Translation

**Objective:** Translate text from one language to another by modeling the probability of target sentences given source sentences.

**Example:**

In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), estimate the probability $\mathbb{P}(e | f)$ where $e$ is the English sentence and $f$ is the foreign sentence.

**MLE Approach:**

- **Data (D):** Parallel corpus of source and target language sentence pairs.
- **Parameters ($\theta$):** Translation probabilities $\mathbb{P}(e | f)$.
- **Likelihood Function:**


$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta | D) = \prod_{(e, f) \in D} \mathbb{P}(e | f)
$$

- **MLE Estimate:**


$$
\hat{\mathbb{P}}(e | f) = \frac{\text{Count}(e, f)}{\text{Count}(f)}
$$

## 5. Visualization with Tables

Visual representations aid in understanding how MLE estimates parameters based on observed data. Below is a detailed example illustrating MLE in the context of word probability estimation.

### Example: Estimating Word Probabilities

**Scenario:**

Given a small corpus, estimate the probability of each word using MLE.

**Corpus:**

```
Data: ["machine", "learning", "is", "fun", "machine", "learning", "machine"]
```

**Objective:**

Estimate $\mathbb{P}(w)$ for each word $w$.

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Count the occurrences of each word.**

2. **Apply MLE to estimate probabilities.**

**Visualization Table:**

| Word       | Count | $\mathbb{P}(w)$ |
|------------|-------|---------------------|
| machine    | 3     | $\frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286$ |
| learning   | 2     | $\frac{2}{7} \approx 0.2857$ |
| is         | 1     | $\frac{1}{7} \approx 0.1429$ |
| fun        | 1     | $\frac{1}{7} \approx 0.1429$ |
| **Total**  | 7     | **1.0**             |

**Interpretation:**

- The word "machine" appears 3 times in the corpus, resulting in an estimated probability of approximately 0.4286.
- The probabilities of all words sum to 1, ensuring a valid probability distribution.

**Python Code:**

```python
from collections import Counter

# Define the corpus
corpus = ["machine", "learning", "is", "fun", "machine", "learning", "machine"]

# Count occurrences of each word
word_counts = Counter(corpus)

# Total number of words
total_words = sum(word_counts.values())

# Calculate MLE probabilities
word_prob = {word: count / total_words for word, count in word_counts.items()}
