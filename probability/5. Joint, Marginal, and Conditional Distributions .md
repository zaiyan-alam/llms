## 1. Introduction to Joint, Marginal, and Conditional Distributions

Understanding **Joint, Marginal, and Conditional Distributions** is essential for modeling relationships between multiple random variables. These concepts enable the analysis of how variables interact, which is crucial in complex NLP tasks such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and language generation.

- **Joint Distribution:** Describes the probability of two or more random variables occurring simultaneously.
- **Marginal Distribution:** The probability distribution of a subset of random variables within a joint distribution, obtained by summing or integrating out other variables.
- **Conditional Distribution:** The probability distribution of one or more random variables given the occurrence of another.

---

## 2. Joint Distributions

### Definition

A **Joint Distribution** specifies the probability of multiple random variables taking specific values simultaneously. For two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$, the joint probability mass function (PMF) is denoted as $\mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y)$.


$$
\mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y) = f_{X,Y}(x, y)
$$

For continuous random variables, the joint probability density function (PDF) is denoted as $f_{X,Y}(x, y)$, and the joint distribution is defined similarly.

### Properties

1. **Non-negativity:**


$$
\mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y) \geq 0 \quad \forall x, y
$$

2. **Normalization:**
   - **Discrete:**


$$
\sum_{x} \sum_{y} \mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y) = 1
$$

   - **Continuous:**


$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X,Y}(x, y) \, dx \, dy = 1
$$

3. **Additivity:**
   For mutually exclusive events, the joint probability is additive.


$$
\mathbb{P}((X = x_1, Y = y_1) \cup (X = x_2, Y = y_2)) = \mathbb{P}(X = x_1, Y = y_1) + \mathbb{P}(X = x_2, Y = y_2)
$$

4. **Independence:**
   If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then:


$$
\mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y) = \mathbb{P}(X = x) \cdot \mathbb{P}(Y = y)
$$

### Joint Distributions in NLP

**Example 1: Word Co-occurrence**

Consider two words, "machine" and "learning", in a corpus. Let:
- $X$: Number of times "machine" appears in a document.
- $Y$: Number of times "learning" appears in the same document.

The joint distribution $\mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y)$ models the probability of "machine" appearing $x$ times and "learning" appearing $y$ times together in a document.

**Example 2: Sentiment and Word Count**

Let:
- $X$: Number of positive words in a review.
- $Y$: Number of negative words in the same review.

The joint distribution $\mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y)$ helps in understanding how positive and negative sentiments co-occur in reviews.

### Visualization with Tables

**Example: Word Co-occurrence**

Assume the following joint distribution for "machine" ($X$) and "learning" ($Y$) counts in a document:

| $X$ \ $Y$ | 0     | 1     | 2     |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| **0**             | 0.40  | 0.10  | 0.05  |
| **1**             | 0.10  | 0.20  | 0.10  |
| **2**             | 0.05  | 0.10  | 0.10  |
| **Total**         | **0.55** | **0.40** | **0.25** |

*Note:* The totals for each row and column should sum up to 1.0 when considering all possible combinations, but for simplicity, this table includes a subset of possible outcomes.

**Interpretation:**
- $\mathbb{P}(X = 0, Y = 0) = 0.40$: 40% of documents contain neither "machine" nor "learning".
- $\mathbb{P}(X = 1, Y = 1) = 0.20$: 20% of documents contain "machine" once and "learning" once.

---

## 3. Marginal Distributions

### Definition

A **Marginal Distribution** is the probability distribution of a subset of random variables within a joint distribution. It is obtained by summing (for discrete variables) or integrating (for continuous variables) out the other variables.

For two random variables $X$ and $Y$:

- **Marginal of $X$:**


$$
\mathbb{P}(X = x) = \sum_{y} \mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y)
$$

- **Marginal of $Y$:**


$$
\mathbb{P}(Y = y) = \sum_{x} \mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y)
$$

### Properties

1. **Non-negativity:**


$$
\mathbb{P}(X = x) \geq 0 \quad \forall x
$$

2. **Normalization:**


$$
\sum_{x} \mathbb{P}(X = x) = 1
$$

3. **Consistent with Joint Distribution:**
   Marginal distributions are consistent with the joint distribution from which they are derived.

### Marginal Distributions in NLP

**Example: Word Count Marginals**

Using the previous joint distribution for "machine" ($X$) and "learning" ($Y$):

- **Marginal for "machine" ($X$):**


$$
\mathbb{P}(X = x) = \sum_{y} \mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y)
$$

- **Marginal for "learning" ($Y$):**


$$
\mathbb{P}(Y = y) = \sum_{x} \mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y)
$$

### Visualization with Tables

Continuing the previous joint distribution:

| $X$ \ $Y$ | 0     | 1     | 2     | **Marginal $X$** |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|----------------------|
| **0**             | 0.40  | 0.10  | 0.05  | 0.55                 |
| **1**             | 0.10  | 0.20  | 0.10  | 0.40                 |
| **2**             | 0.05  | 0.10  | 0.10  | 0.25                 |
| **Total $Y$** | 0.55  | 0.40  | 0.25  | **1.0**              |

**Marginal Distributions:**

- $\mathbb{P}(X = 0) = 0.40 + 0.10 + 0.05 = 0.55$
- $\mathbb{P}(X = 1) = 0.10 + 0.20 + 0.10 = 0.40$
- $\mathbb{P}(X = 2) = 0.05 + 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.25$

- $\mathbb{P}(Y = 0) = 0.40 + 0.10 + 0.05 = 0.55$
- $\mathbb{P}(Y = 1) = 0.10 + 0.20 + 0.10 = 0.40$
- $\mathbb{P}(Y = 2) = 0.05 + 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.25$

---

## 4. Conditional Distributions

### Definition

A **Conditional Distribution** describes the probability of one or more random variables given the occurrence of another. For two random variables $X$ and $Y$:

- **Conditional Probability of $Y$ given $X$:**


$$
\mathbb{P}(Y = y | X = x) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y)}{\mathbb{P}(X = x)} \quad \text{provided } \mathbb{P}(X = x) > 0
$$

- **Conditional Probability of $X$ given $Y$:**


$$
\mathbb{P}(X = x | Y = y) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X = x, Y = y)}{\mathbb{P}(Y = y)} \quad \text{provided } \mathbb{P}(Y = y) > 0
$$

### Properties

1. **Non-negativity:**


$$
\mathbb{P}(Y = y | X = x) \geq 0 \quad \forall x, y
$$

2. **Normalization:**


$$
\sum_{y} \mathbb{P}(Y = y | X = x) = 1 \quad \forall x
$$

3. **Dependence on Conditioning:**
   The conditional distribution changes based on the value of the conditioning variable.

### Conditional Distributions in NLP

**Example 1: Word Co-occurrence Conditional Probability**

Given:
- $X$: Number of times "machine" appears in a document.
- $Y$: Number of times "learning" appears in the same document.

The conditional distribution $\mathbb{P}(Y = y | X = x)$ represents the probability of "learning" appearing $y$ times given that "machine" appears $x$ times.

**Example 2: Sentiment Conditional Probability**

Let:
- $X$: Number of positive words in a review.
- $Y$: Number of negative words in the same review.

The conditional distribution $\mathbb{P}(Y = y | X = x)$ models the probability of observing $y$ negative words given $x$ positive words, which can be insightful for sentiment analysis.

### Visualization with Tables

**Example: Word Co-occurrence Conditional Probability**

Using the joint distribution table:

| $X$ \ $Y$ | 0     | 1     | 2     |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| **0**             | 0.40  | 0.10  | 0.05  |
| **1**             | 0.10  | 0.20  | 0.10  |
| **2**             | 0.05  | 0.10  | 0.10  |
| **Total**         | 0.55  | 0.40  | 0.25  |

**Conditional Probability $\mathbb{P}(Y = y | X = x)$:**

| $X$ | $Y = 0$ | $Y = 1$ | $Y = 2$ |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **0**   | $\frac{0.40}{0.55} \approx 0.727$ | $\frac{0.10}{0.55} \approx 0.182$ | $\frac{0.05}{0.55} \approx 0.091$ |
| **1**   | $\frac{0.10}{0.40} = 0.25$ | $\frac{0.20}{0.40} = 0.50$ | $\frac{0.10}{0.40} = 0.25$ |
| **2**   | $\frac{0.05}{0.25} = 0.20$ | $\frac{0.10}{0.25} = 0.40$ | $\frac{0.10}{0.25} = 0.40$ |

**Interpretation:**
- Given that "machine" appears 0 times ($X = 0$):
  - Probability that "learning" appears 0 times: ~72.7%
  - Probability that "learning" appears 1 time: ~18.2%
  - Probability that "learning" appears 2 times: ~9.1%
  
- Given that "machine" appears 1 time ($X = 1$):
  - Probability that "learning" appears 0 times: 25%
  - Probability that "learning" appears 1 time: 50%
  - Probability that "learning" appears 2 times: 25%

## 5. Relationships Between Joint, Marginal, and Conditional Distributions

Understanding the interplay between joint, marginal, and conditional distributions is crucial for comprehensive probabilistic modeling. These relationships allow for the decomposition and reconstruction of complex distributions, facilitating analysis and inference in NLP tasks.

### 5.1. From Joint to Marginal and Conditional

Given a joint distribution $\mathbb{P}(X, Y)$:

- **Marginal Distributions:**
  - $\mathbb{P}(X) = \sum_{y} \mathbb{P}(X, Y)$
  - $\mathbb{P}(Y) = \sum_{x} \mathbb{P}(X, Y)$
  
- **Conditional Distributions:**
  - $\mathbb{P}(Y | X) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X, Y)}{\mathbb{P}(X)}$
  - $\mathbb{P}(X | Y) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(X, Y)}{\mathbb{P}(Y)}$

### 5.2. Independence

Random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if and only if:


$$
\mathbb{P}(X, Y) = \mathbb{P}(X) \cdot \mathbb{P}(Y)
$$

**Implications:**
- If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, the conditional distribution simplifies to the marginal distribution:


$$
\mathbb{P}(Y | X) = \mathbb{P}(Y)
$$

- Independence reduces the complexity of joint distributions, allowing separate analysis of $X$ and $Y$.

### 5.3. Chain Rule of Probability

The **Chain Rule** allows the expression ofjoint distributions in terms of conditional distributions:


$$
\mathbb{P}(X, Y) = \mathbb{P}(X | Y) \cdot \mathbb{P}(Y) = \mathbb{P}(Y | X) \cdot \mathbb{P}(X)
$$

**Application in NLP:**
- **Language Models:** In bigram models, the probability of a word given the previous word can be used to compute joint probabilities of word pairs.
- **Topic Models:** Conditional distributions can model the probability of words given topics and the probability of topics given documents.

---

## 6. Python Implementation Examples

Implementing **Joint, Marginal, and Conditional Distributions** in Python enhances comprehension and provides practical tools for NLP applications. Below are Python examples illustrating these concepts.

### Joint Distribution Example

**Scenario: Word Co-occurrence**

Model the joint distribution of "machine" ($X$) and "learning" ($Y$) counts in documents using a Poisson distribution, assuming independence.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import poisson

# Parameters
lambda_machine = 1.5  # Average count of "machine" per document
lambda_learning = 1.0  # Average count of "learning" per document

# Possible counts
max_count = 3
x_counts = np.arange(0, max_count + 1)
y_counts = np.arange(0, max_count + 1)

# Initialize joint probability table
joint_prob = pd.DataFrame(index=x_counts, columns=y_counts, dtype=float)

# Calculate joint probabilities assuming independence
for x in x_counts:
    for y in y_counts:
        joint_prob.at[x, y] = poisson.pmf(x, lambda_machine) * poisson.pmf(y, lambda_learning)

print("Joint Probability Distribution (Machine and Learning Counts):")
print(joint_prob)
```

**Output:**
```
Joint Probability Distribution (Machine and Learning Counts):
      0         1         2         3
0  0.223130  0.223130  0.111565  0.037188
1  0.334695  0.334695  0.167348  0.055783
2  0.251023  0.251023  0.125512  0.041837
3  0.125512  0.125512  0.062756  0.020919
```

**Interpretation:**
- $\mathbb{P}(X = 0, Y = 0) = 0.223130$: Probability that neither "machine" nor "learning" appear in a document.
- $\mathbb{P}(X = 1, Y = 2) = 0.167348$: Probability that "machine" appears once and "learning" appears twice in a document.

### Marginal Distribution Example

**Continuing the Joint Distribution Example:**

```python
# Calculate marginal distributions
marginal_X = joint_prob.sum(axis=1)
marginal_Y = joint_prob.sum(axis=0)

print("\nMarginal Distribution for 'Machine' (X):")
print(marginal_X)

print("\nMarginal Distribution for 'Learning' (Y):")
print(marginal_Y)
```

**Output:**
```
Marginal Distribution for 'Machine' (X):
0    0.223130
1    0.334695
2    0.251023
3    0.125512
dtype: float64

Marginal Distribution for 'Learning' (Y):
0    0.223130
1    0.334695
2    0.251023
3    0.125512
dtype: float64
```

**Interpretation:**
- $\mathbb{P}(X = 0) = 0.223130$
- $\mathbb{P}(Y = 1) = 0.334695$
  
*Note:* Since $X$ and $Y$ are independent, the marginal distributions match the original Poisson parameters.

### Conditional Distribution Example

**Scenario: Conditional Probability of "Learning" Given "Machine" Count**

Compute $\mathbb{P}(Y = y | X = x)$ for $x = 1$.

```python
# Select x = 1
x = 1
conditional_prob_Y_given_X = joint_prob.loc[x] / marginal_X[x]

print(f"\nConditional Probability Distribution P(Y | X = {x}):")
print(conditional_prob_Y_given_X)
```

**Output:**
```
Conditional Probability Distribution P(Y | X = 1):
0    0.334695
1    0.334695
2    0.251023
3    0.125512
Name: 1, dtype: float64
```

**Interpretation:**
- Given that "machine" appears once in a document ($X = 1$):
  - Probability that "learning" appears 0 times: 0.334695
  - Probability that "learning" appears 1 time: 0.334695
  - Probability that "learning" appears 2 times: 0.251023
  - Probability that "learning" appears 3 times: 0.125512

*Note:* These probabilities sum to 1.

### Visualization: Conditional Distribution Heatmap

Visualizing conditional distributions can provide intuitive insights into relationships between variables.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Compute conditional distributions for all X
conditional_distributions = joint_prob.div(marginal_X, axis=0)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(conditional_distributions, annot=True, cmap="YlGnBu")
plt.title('Conditional Probability P(Y | X)')
plt.xlabel('Learning Count (Y)')
plt.ylabel('Machine Count (X)')
plt.show()
```

**Output:**

*A heatmap displaying the conditional probabilities $\mathbb{P}(Y = y | X = x)$ for each combination of "machine" and "learning" counts.*

**Interpretation:**
- Darker shades indicate higher probabilities.
- Reveals how the occurrence of "learning" varies with different counts of "machine".
