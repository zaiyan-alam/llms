## Probability

1. Basic probability concepts:
   - Sample spaces and events
   - Probability axioms
   - Conditional probability
   - Independence
2. Random variables:
   - Discrete and continuous random variables
   - Probability mass functions (PMFs) and probability density functions (PDFs)
   - Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)
3. Expectation and moments:
   - Expected value
   - Variance and standard deviation
   - Covariance and correlation
4. Common probability distributions:
   - Bernoulli and Binomial
   - Poisson
   - Gaussian (Normal)
   - Exponential
   - Multinomial
5. Joint, marginal, and conditional distributions
6. Bayes' theorem and applications
7. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
8. Bayesian inference:
   - Prior and posterior distributions
   - Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation
9. Information theory:
   - Entropy
   - Cross-entropy
   - Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
   - Mutual information
